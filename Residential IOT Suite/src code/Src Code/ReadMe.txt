ServerA folder stores the frontend code + Flask Backend controls
ServerB folder stores the security backend server + tensorflow object detection code (which is quite bulky)



Server A Usage:
run "npm start" in react-flask-app/
run HelloWorld.py in react-flask-app/api/


Server B Usage:
sudo python3 rpiWebServer/HelloWorld.py
python3 function_tests/object_detection/Object_detection_picamera.py


However, need devices and only part of front end is displayable
Don't worry, there is an included demonstration video :)
